# The_Night_Cage_Tile_Helper

A GitHub Pages static site to handle tile setup and drawing during gameplay so the players do not need to worry so much about that part.

## Todos

### MVP

- Radios to indicate number of players (1-4 or 5)
- Button for drawing a tile
- Spot on page for the image of the tile the player drew to show
- create button for them to indicate the piece has been placed (blank the image when a piece has been placed)
- Button for discarding pieces from the stack
  - If discarding a special piece (monster) let the user know what they must do (usually play the piece and fight immediately)

### Future Features

- Map on screen allowing players to place and remove pieces as necessary
  - Will need to allow rotating the pieces
- Indicate on map which spaces need filled when a new tile is placed
- tooltips to help users with rules as pieces are played and discarded
- Handle end-game conditions
